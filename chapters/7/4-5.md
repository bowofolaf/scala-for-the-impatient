**4. Why do u think scala language designers provided the package object syntax instead of letting you add functions and variables to a package**
Its a limitation of the Java JVM

**5. Whats the meaning of private[com] def giveRaise(rate: Double)**
It limits the scope of giveRaise to the com package

**Is it very useful?**
No. Most packages are children of "com" and therefore this function wont be 
very private at all and can be accessed by a lot of unrelated code
